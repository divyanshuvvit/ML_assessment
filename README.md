Assignment: 

1. Write a Python function that takes a list of records, where each record is a dictionary containing the name of a city and various types of weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity). The function should aggregate this data to provide insights such as the average temperature and humidity for each city. However, each record may not contain all types of data. The solution should gracefully handle missing data.

2. Write a Python function to perform prime factorization of a given integer. The function should return a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a prime factor and its corresponding exponent. For example, given the integer 60, the function should return [(2, 2), (3, 1), (5, 1)] since 60 = 2^2 * 3^1 * 5^1. 

3.Data Manipulation Challenge:
Scenario: A table named products contains columns id, name, and price.

Task: Write a SQL query to increase the price of all products by 10% and display the new prices along with the product names.
